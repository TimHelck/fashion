I countered with the Vanderbilt Cup [a race that ran in Long Island, NY and that had captivated Helck as a child]. \"But that's a Bridge tournament\" was the Editor's rejoinder. It took a carefully-done sketch (on speculation) to convince Editor [Bernard] Geis that the first U. S. victory in classic auto racing, Robertson's and the Loco's win in the 1908 Vanderbilt, was indeed a great moment in American Sport.</div> <p>Helck inspired Editor Geis to commision a series of eight paintings devoted to great moments in American motor sports. The first painting appeared in the December 1944 issue of <i>Esquire</i> and the final one in November 1946. This series proved the existence of an audience for automotive art and established Helck as its foremost practitioner. Although he continued to do advertising work for major commercial campaigns (Chevy Truck, National Steel, General Electric) well into the 1950's, during this period more and more of his output became devoted to illustrations of automotive history, either for magazine articles or commissioned by private collectors.</p> </div>",
